# Core-Location
An app using core location

## About
This app is the result of my studies using core location. It is a simple app, only to check how core location works and how can I use it the best way possible.

## Features
* Request authorization of the user to use his location
* A latitude and longitude of the current location
* Create a button to update the latitude and longitude (TODO)
